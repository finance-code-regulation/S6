# Series 6 – Investment Company and Variable Contracts Products Representative

Securities Professional Exam Requirements.</br></br>
It is required that all NEW representatives  take and pass the Securities Industry Essentials® (SIE®) Exam as a pre-requisite to taking the Series 6 Exam. The FINRA Series 6 is a corequisite exam that needs to be successfully completed in addition to the Series 63, 65, or 66 exam before a candidate can apply to register with a state. As individuals, we understand different people have different needs and we can also accomodate individual sessions focusing and targeting on "problem areas" to position our students to pass the exams on the first attempt.</br>

Compared to the SIE exam questions, Series 6 questions are much more situational than definitional, and require a deeper knowledge of investment company and variable products.  After passing the SIE and Series 6 Exams, representatives must also pass at least ONE of the following Securities Law Exams in order to be registered to conduct business in any State, and must be approved in their *home* state.

1. Series 63 – Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam 
2. Series 65 – Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam
